# CheckBud

This app was developed to streamline the workflow during code-checking for a voucher-service. It enables the user to keep track of active, faulty and deprecated voucher codes, as (s)he goes through each.

A side activity keeps track of previous input.

Finally, after pay-day the app can be reset so as to start the counts anew.
